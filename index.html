  <p>John Von Neumann was a mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, and engineer. John has a important role in the history of comupaters as he created the strongest mathematics comuter of his time to help the creation of the Manhtattan project, Little boy and the Fat Man.<hr></p>

  <p> Since Neumann was a kid he has always been very intelligent. In his

    he went to study math and chemisty in the Swiss federal University.</P>

  
    <p> In 1943 John begain to work on the 
     
      <b><a href="/pages/manhattan.html">Manhtattan project</a></b>, 
      
      this is where he started working on comupters. John changed the argitectular layout of the comutars to creat the fastest mathematic computer of his time.</p> 

 
      <p> Neumann created a new
