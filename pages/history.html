                The Manhattan project was the creation of two atomic bombs named Big Boy and Fat Man that were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the government of America during World War two. It took four years (1942-1945) to build the two atomic bombs with over 500,000 people contributing to the project.

                John Von Neumann was asked to help work on the project in 1943 while he was giving lectures. He accepted the offer and began working on the mathematical foundation on quantum mechanics but was later moved to help work on the computer aspect of the bomb. Neumann created a new architecture layout of computers creating the fastest mathematic computer of his time.
